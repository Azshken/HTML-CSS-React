# HTML-CSS-React
My path of learning frontend development. Projects created during this learning.

I've began [learning HTML + CSS](https://scrimba.com/learn/htmlandcss) on **Scrimba** on 17.10.2023

This is a middle-step of [learning React](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) that I've started on scrimba on 16.10.2023
React is needed for Solidity full stack Web3 development.

I've started learning Solidity and JS in July 31st 2023 on [Alchemy university](https://university.alchemy.com/home).  
FreeCodeCamp -> "[Learn Blockchain, Solidity, and Full Stack Web3 Development with JavaScript â€“ 32-Hour Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyMwXuJrbJQ)" - I'm plowing through this monstrosity

[SpeedRun Ethereum](https://speedrunethereum.com/builders/0xaA939958349E0597a784163309a272BD5898bea2) and a cadet on [BuidlGuidl](https://app.buidlguidl.com/builders/0xaA939958349E0597a784163309a272BD5898bea2).

Scaffold-ETH has lead me to learning React. If someone wants to build a good frontEnd for smart contracts they ought to learn HTML->CSS->JS->React.

I'm intrigued by [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) and its simplicity - I'm curious if it can be implemented with solidity.

Interested in Python data science (querying & partitioning data to make sense and predict future outcomes, behaviours)

# HTML-CSS-React
My path of learning frontend development. Projects created during this learning.

I've began learning HTML + CSS on Scrimba on 17.10.2023

This is a middle-step of learning React that I've started on scrimba on 16.10.2023
React is needed for Solidity full stack Web3 development.

I've started learning Solidity and JS in July 31st 2023 on Alchemy university.
FreeCodeCamp -> "Learn Blockchain, Solidity, and Full Stack Web3 Development with JavaScript â€“ 32-Hour Course"

SpeedRun Ethereum. I'm a member on BuidlGuidl

Scaffold-ETH lead me to learning React. If someone wants to build a good frontEnd for smart contracts they ought to learn HTML->CSS->JS->React.

I'm intrigued by HTMX and its simplicity - I'm curious if it can be implemented with solidity.

Interested in Python data science (querying & partitioning data to make sense and predict future outcomes, behaviours)

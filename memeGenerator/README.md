# Meme Generator 
This is the second React project from the [3rd section of the course on Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/playlist/prXJpCQ). 

I've recreated this section's project in VS code using Tailwind css.

Learned about useState, useEffect and how to use them; how to extract data from a data file; how to excess and use data via an API call.
Project's [website](https://meme-generator-five-lake.vercel.app/).

Marching forward to the 4th, last section of the course, which is a more of a practice section.

Also beging to forget solidity smart contracts coding. Looking forward to continue with the projects on alchemy and finally begining to create my own dApps.
